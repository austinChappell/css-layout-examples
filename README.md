# Project Title

Day 4 Assignments

## Project Description

This is a combination of three assignments we did on our fourth day at The Iron Yard.

### Things to know

Everything written in the CSS files for the Apple project and the Ashurbanipal project were written from scratch based off of mockups. The widgets assignment used mockups, but we simply had to troubleshoot and correct some starter files we were given using flex-box.
